# forms-angular

## No nonsense forms for the MEAN stack

This is the server side part of forms-angular.  The client side part is a
bower package (also called forms-angular).

## Installation

    $ npm install forms-angular

## Demonstration and Documentation

There is a demonstration application with detailed documentation and several 
example schemas running at http://forms-ng.herokuapp.com.

Although it is a bit premature for production use (though I am doing it) the
"minimal" folder shows how you might go about doing it in the simplest way.  
It has its own README file.

## Contributing, Tests

See https://github.com/mchapman/forms-angular for tests.  This is also the repo that you should fork
if you want to contribute.
