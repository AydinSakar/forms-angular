An minimal example of forms-angular - a way of creating forms in aAngular / Bootstrap / Express application.  It contains one very simple modeland uses the local instance of MongoDB (assuming there is one).Copy the contents of minimal and subfolders to your drive, run    [sudo] npm installin the root, and start the server by running    node ./server/server.jsYou can see the app by visiting http://0.0.0.0:3001 in your browser.There is a demonstration application with several example schemas running athttp://forms-ng.herokuapp.com
