An example app to demonstrate forms-angular - a way of creating forms in aAngular / Bootstrap / Express application.There is a demonstration application with several example schemas running athttp://forms-ng.herokuapp.com.Although it is a bit premature for production use (though I am doing it) the"minimal" folder shows how yo might go about doing it in the simplest way.  It hasits own README file.
