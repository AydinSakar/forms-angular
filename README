An example app to demonstrate forms-angular - a way of creating forms on the MEAN stack(Mongo - Express - Angular - Node) with the addition of Mongoose and Twitter Bootstrap(the MANTBEM stack?)There is a demonstration application with detailed documentation and several exampleschemas running at http://forms-ng.herokuapp.com.Although it is a bit premature for production use (though I am doing it) the"minimal" folder shows how you might go about doing it in the simplest way.  It hasits own README file.
